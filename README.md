# Honeycomb

## Next major version

The alpha of the next major version (v4) is released (see the [changelog](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/blob/next/CHANGELOG.md) in the [`next`](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/tree/next) branch). It's a complete rewrite in TypeScript with all new shiny "traversers" ðŸ˜Ž.

I could really use your feedback about this new version, so please take a look at the [readme](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/tree/next#honeycomb) in the [`next`](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/tree/next) branch to see how you can start using it. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/issues) and tell me what you like and/or don't like. Thanks! âœ¨

Another hex grid library made in TypeScript, heavily inspired by [Red Blob Games'](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) blog posts and code samples.

All existing JS hex grid libraries I could find are coupled with some form of view. Most often a `<canvas>` element or the browser DOM. I want more separation of concernsâ€¦and a new hobby project to spend countless hours on.

## Ideas for v4.0

- [ ] hex functions (apply to single hexes):
  - [ ] ?   add
  - [ ] cartesian
  - [ ] ?   cartesianToCube (alias: toCube)
  - [ ] center
  - [ ] ?   coordinates (returns cube by default?)
  - [ ] corners
  - [ ] cube
  - [ ] cubeToCartesian (alias: toCartesian)
  - [ ] equals
  - [ ] from (convert anything? to a hex)
  - [ ] height
  - [ ] isFlat
  - [ ] isPointy
  - [ ] lerp
  - [ ] nudge
  - [ ] round
  - [ ] ?   set
  - [ ] ?   subtract
  - [ ] thirdCoordinate
  - [ ] toString
  - [ ] width
- [ ] grid functions (apply to multiple hexes):
  - [ ] ?   distance
  - [ ] hexToPoint
  - [ ] pointToHex
  - [ ] get
  - [ ] hexesBetween
  - [ ] hexesInRange
  - [ ] ?   line (can be infinite)
  - [ ] neighborsOf
  - [ ] pointHeight
  - [ ] pointWidth
  - [ ] ?   set
  - [ ] parallelogram
  - [ ] triangle (can be infinite?)
  - [ ] hexagon (can be infinite?)
  - [ ] rectangle
  - [ ] ring (can be infinite?)
  - [ ] spiral (can be infinite)

### Coordinates

- [ ] Store coordinates as ~~"tuples" (arrays)~~ simple 3D objects. Investigate whether arrays or objects (without prototype?) ~~(maybe even strings, ArrayBuffer?)~~ are more performant.
- [x] Take [Amit's advice](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-comparison) and use axial coordinates by default.
  - [x] ~~Use `x`, `y` and `z` for cube coordinates?~~
  - [x] ~~Rename cartesian to offset?~~
  - [ ] Also use [doubled coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-doubled)?
- [x] Problem: how to differentiate between 2D hex coordinate and 2D "pixel" coordinate?
  **Solution**: `CartesianCoordinates` is an alias of `Point`. A "coordinate" is a point in a grid, a "point" is any 2D/3D point in any system (e.g. a grid).
- [x] ~~Offer `Point()` function (with `add()` etc methods)? And/or a way to convert tuples to points/coordinates?~~ Converting from/to tuples is outside this lib's scope.

### Hex

- [x] Hexes only have axial coordinates (most methods require axial coordinates anyway).
- [x] Make default origin the center of the hex (currently is top left corner)? Can't remember why it's not already the center.
  - [ ] Add `boundingBox` (with `topLeft`, `topRight`, etc)
  - [x] Origin should also be able to set with a function that's called with the hex prototype (?) so that width, height or corners can be used to determine origin
- [ ] Make it possible to use own createHex() functions (this also means hex prototypes aren't set by Honeycomb)?
- [ ] Different groups of functions:
  1. Functions that **require both** a hex prototype and a hex (e.g. `toPoint()`)
  2. Functions that require a hex prototype and **optionally a hex** (e.g. `corners()` with just a hex prototype returns the relative corners of any hex, `corners()` with both a hex prototype and a hex returns the absolute corners of the hex)
  3. Functions that require **only** a **hex prototype** (e.g. `width()`)
  4. Functions that require **only** a **hex** (e.g. `equals()`)
  - [x] What to do when group 1 is only called with a hex prototype? ~~Return a function that accepts a hex.~~ Todo: Log a warning
  - [ ] (Naming) conventions for these groups?
    - group 1: ~~offer higher order function that accepts a hex prototype (prefixed with `create`, e.g. `createToPoint()`?) and returns a function that accepts a hex. This can be used to create hex prototype methods using partial application (i.e. `hex.toPoint()`).~~ When used as a static method: name start with `hex` (e.g. `hexToPoint()`) and accepts a hex. When used as a prototype method: accepts no arguments (works on instance).
    - group 2: 1st parameter is the hex prototype, 2nd optional parameter the hex. The return value depends on whether the 2nd parameter was passed. This can also be used as a static method on Hex or a prototype method (then the function is partially applied with the hex prototype).
    - group 3: are both available as a static and prototype method.
    - group 4: available as a static method and a partially applied prototype method.
- [x] By default hexes only have coordinates as state. Should be possible for users to add state:
    ```ts
    interface CustomHex {
      customProp: string
      customMethod(): void
    }
    // the properties of CustomHex are available to all hexes (because they're added to the prototype)
    // todo: rename `createHexPrototype()` to `defineHex()`?
    const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype<CustomHex>({ size: 20, customProp: 'custom', customMethod() {} })
    ```
  - [x] how can you type functions that accept hexes? RxJS operators seem to be able to fix this.
- [x] ~~Maybe either have pointy or flat hexes and leave it to rendering if they're pointy or flat?~~ All the `if` statements that check whether hexes are pointy or flat may be resolved by having separate functions for pointy and flat hexes and using those in the Hex prototype. This doesn't seem to improve performance.
- [ ] Investigate if memoization helps

### Grid

#### Terminology

- *grid instance*: an iterable object that represents hexes in a plane (possibly with infinite dimensions). The order of iteration is not important?
- *concrete grid*: a grid instance with finite hexes stored as a concrete data type (array, object, string, etc)
- *grid-like*: an iterable that can be converted to a grid instance
- *traverser*: a ~~generator~~ (generators are not performant) function that determines how a grid instance is traversed. It can be called with a start hex, start direction and something to indicate when to stop traversing, e.g.:
  - at a certain hex
  - after n hexes
  - when a boundary is reached
  - combination of the above

  The result of a traversal is always a new grid (the traversed grid isn't mutated, the hexes in it can be mutated though), this can be added/subtracted/intersected/differenced, mapped/reduced or just ignored (in case of side-effects).

#### API

- [ ] **Creation**:
  - [x] `new Grid(hexPrototype)`: can be traversed indefinitely, ~~determine default traverser (spiral?)~~ the default traverser doesn't emit hexes

  `options` are more or less the same options as can be passed in current version of Honeycomb:
- [ ] **Traversal** (todo: what to do when a boundary is reached?):
  - [x] `grid.rectangle(options)`
  - [ ] `grid.hexagon(options)`
  - [ ] ~~`grid.parallelogram(options)`~~ add if requested
  - [ ] ~~`grid.triangle(options)`~~ add if requested
  - [ ] `grid.spiral(options)` (`grid.ring(options)` would be a spiral that stops)
  - [x] ~~`grid.line(options)`~~ see the `move()` traverser
  - [ ] ~~`grid.zigzag(options)`?~~ add if requested
  - [ ] todo: methods that use path finding algorithms like A*?
  - [x] ~~`grid.createTraverser(function* customTraverser(options) {})(options)`~~
  - [ ] Traversers can be piped with transformers, which are called with:
    ```ts
    interface TraversalState {
      hex: Hex         // current hex
      index: number    // index of current hex since start of traversal
      inGrid: boolean  // whether the traverser is within bounds of the source grid
      sourceGrid: Grid // todo: needed?
      grid: Grid       // hexes traversed so far, todo: needed?
    }
    ```
    Pseudo code:
    ```ts
    grid.someTraverser(options).pipe(
      filter((traversalState) => boolean),
      reject((traversalState) => boolean), // complement of filter()
      tap((traversalState) => void),       // for side-effects
      until((traversalState) => boolean),  // to signal when traversal should stop
    )
    ```
  - [x] ðŸ‘‰ Make traversers even more fine-grained (~~seems very complex~~ it is, but worth it!)
    ```ts
    // this creates a ring around startCoordinates
    grid
      .traverse((
        at(startCoordinates),
        move(Compass.E),
        // todo: use repeat() somehow: repeat.withIndex(5, (i) => move(i + 1))
        move(Compass.SW),
        move(Compass.W),
        move(Compass.NW),
        move(Compass.NE),
        move(Compass.E),
      )
      .run()
    ```
- [ ] **Combination**:
  - [ ] `grid.add(otherGrid)` / `grid.union(otherGrid)`
  - [ ] `grid.subtract(otherGrid)`
  - [ ] `grid.intersect(otherGrid)`
  - [ ] `grid.difference(otherGrid)`
  - [x] ~~`grid.mergeMap()` / `grid.zip()`~~ these ~~seem~~ are useless
- [ ] **Assertion**:

  Maybe make shortcut methods for these:
  - [x] ~~`grid.someTraverser(options).pipe(until(({ hex }) => hex.someState)).size > 0`: grid.some() whether any hex passes predicate~~
  - [x] ~~`grid.someTraverser(options).pipe(until(({ hex }) => !hex.someState)).size === grid.size` grid.every() whether all hexes pass predicate~~
- [ ] **Mutation/reduction**?:
  - [ ] `grid.reduce((any, traversalState) => any, any)`
  - [ ] `grid.toArray()`
  - [ ] `grid.toJSON()`
  - [ ] `grid.toString()`
  - [ ] `grid.toLinkedList()` todo: ???
  - [ ] `grid.toRecord()` todo: ???
  - [ ] `grid.toMap()` todo: ???
  - [ ] `grid.toSet()` todo: ???

#### Other ideas

- [ ] Define hex prototype -> define grid with hex prototype -> (optional: create iterable to traverse grid) -> use (existing) iterable to either create a concrete grid (stored in memory) or traverse an existing (concrete) grid (for mapping/reducing/filtering).
  ```ts
  const hexPrototype = createHexPrototype()
  const Grid = defineGrid(hexPrototype)

  // creating grids (these return "traversers" using a [Symbol.iterator] property)
  const rectangle = Grid.rectangle({ width: 6, height: 4 })
  const ring = Grid.ring({ radius: 2 })
  const traverse = Grid.createTraverser(function* (hexPrototype, arg1, arg2) {
    // yield hexes
  })
  // generator gets called internally like so: (...args) => generator(hexPrototype, ...args)
  const hexes = traverse('arg1', 'arg2')

  // creating concrete grids
  const array = rectangle.toArray()
  const customArray = rectangle.reduce((acc, hex) => acc.concat(hex), [] as Hex[])
  // todo: should the following be a built-in thing?
  interface CustomGrid {
    [coordinates: string]: Hex
    hexes: Hex[]
  }
  const obj = rectangle.reduce((acc, hex) => {
    acc[hex] = hex
    acc.hexes.push(hex)
    return acc
  }, { hexes: [] } as CustomGrid)

  // converting concrete grids to "virtual" grids
  // accepts any iterable (so also Grid iterables):
  const virtualGrid1 = Grid.from(array)
  // traverser can also be used:
  const virtualGrid2 = traverse('arg1', 'arg2').over(array) // todo: consider

  // combining grids
  rectangle.over(array) // todo: consider
  rectangle.union(obj)
  rectangle.difference(ring)
  ```
  - [x] ~~these generators produce infinite grids, how to signal boundaries?~~ Traversers accept an optional width or height and/or a `stop()` predicate function that signal when to return from the generator.
  - [x] Problem: generators can't be "reused" once `done`.
- [ ] Do something with this: [https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage)?
- [x] There should be a way to loop over hexes in a grid with **transducers**?
- [ ] Do something with matrices?

### General

- [ ] remove "hex" from functions in hex folder (e.g. `createHex()` plainly becomes `create()`)?
- [ ] Add functionality related to [egdes](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb/issues/58#issuecomment-642099947)
